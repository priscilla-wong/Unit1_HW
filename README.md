​

They also specialize in industry-specific research and provide unique data and market information to technological, scientific, agricultural firms, and more.

They offer mass data options for financial risk analytics, managed corporate actions, and other economics intelligence. Their financial technology solutions services provide enterprise-tailored products for financial firms to manage operational and investment platforms.

    - IHS Markit uses Amazon Web Services' cloud technology to deploy many of their proprietary applications such as Markit Enterprise Data which is a tool that enables firms to manage and validate their acquired data

    - IHS Markit was recently acquired by S&P Global, therefore combining their world-leading portfolio and client-base with another major competitor. This will further extend the reach of information technology and analytics products in the wealth management and investment management spaces
​

    - Market share: They have continuously accumulated many competing information technology firms over their years of operation and have become a world leader in information tech and enterprise solutions, and recently joined S&P Global

​
## Recommendations
​
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - I would advise IHS Markit create an API technology similar to that of Bloomberg's or Factset's. Many trading firms rely on data feeds for pricing, volume, performance, and more live market measures to complete daily tasks, reports, and analyses. Being able to manipulate the live data feeds within the end-user's terminal or computer can make research and record-keeping much more efficient than relying on static data that is usually provided by financial data products. Firms like Bloomberg provide this technology at an incredibly high price, even for enterprise level support. IHS Markit could use their existing infrastructures and products to create a product that can compete in performance and price.
​
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - Markit started their firm solely to provide daily credit default swap pricing. Expanding this service into other market assets such as equities can greatly increase their popularity and reach with new and current clients.
​
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    - Cloud technologies, Artificial Intelligence, big data, API
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - The combination of the above technologies improves scalability, speed, diversity, and quality of data being provided. Additionally, API's make it easier for the end-user to interact with the data being provided.
